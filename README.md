A small project to understand API's and design. 

Things I learned: 
- the CSS took waaaaaay too long and i don't know if this is because i am not using a framework or library
- by spending so much time on the css, i got a little better but ultimately lost focus on the actual programming end
- the logic behind this app is super simple: fetch data from api, display it, the end
- i need to try projects with greater functional complexity and less of the front end work
- i can finally see the appeal of react and tailwind :(
- THERE ARE 1026 POKEMON AS OF WRITING THIS
